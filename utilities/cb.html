        <h1>Chromebook Utilities</h1>
        <h2>Dedicated to helping people bypass restrictions on specifically the Chromebook.</h2>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h1 id="extensions">Extensions</h1>
            <h2>Disabling extensions</h2>
            <h2>Method 1 (most effective)</h2>
            Hold the refresh button on the top row of your keyboard and spam (rapid click multiple times) click the power button button (all the way top right of keyboard) then log into your computer as fast as you can and they will be disabled temporarily for a lil bit. Works for some people, doesn't work for others.

            <h2>Method 2</h2>
            <p>This isn't too hard to do. Though, it is only possible to <b>temporarily</b> disable them.<br>According
                to others around, it may not work for everyone (it works for me)</p>
            <h3>How to do it</h3>
            <nl>
                <li>1. Copy and paste this into the address
                    bar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chrome://restart</code></li>
                <li>2. Press enter.</li>
            </nl>
            <p>It will restart your chromebook and keep you logged in which restarts extensions so it makes it spend
                time
                to reload.<br>
                You can also do this
                URL:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chrome://inducebrowsercrashforrealz</code><br>
                It will crash your chromebook which just restarts it.
                <br><br>
                Tested on the LineWize extension so far.
            </p>

            <h2>Method 3</h2>
            <p>This may not work for all extensions and chromebooks but it might.</p>
            <p>Type <code>chrome://inspect/#extensions</code> into the address bar and press enter.<br>
                Find the extension(s) you want to disable.<br>
                Click “inspect”. There will be a series of tabs on the top. Click “console”.<br>
                Then, at the bottom there is a type pad. Write down: <code>window.close(true)</code> THEN BOOM.<br>
                It’s gone.<br><br>To reverse this, restart your computer.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Inspect extensions</h2>
            <p>I don't know why this would be useful and it may not work for everyone is dev tools is disabled but you
                can inspect some chrome extensions.<br>
                To do it, copy and paste this into the address bar and press
                enter:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chrome://inspect/#extensions</code></p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h2>Secret settings</h2>
            <p>I randomly stumbled across this. It lets you do modify some secret settings.<br>
                <b>Hint: If <code>chrome://settings</code> or other things such as that URL are blocked by an extension,
                </b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>To do this, enter <code>chrome://flags</code></p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h2>Secret terminal/command line (crosh)</h2>
            <p>Crosh is the terminal/command line for Chromebooks.<br>
                To do it...</p>
            <nl>
                <li>1. Press <code>ctrl+alt+t</code> on the chromebook.</li>
            </nl>
            <p>This is the shortcut for opening crosh.<br><br>
                Your school will likely try to block it by automatically closing it.<br>
                There is a way around this though.<br><br>
                You know how you can drag tabs around on chrome to reposition them?<br>
                Crosh opens up like a tab. Simply click and drag that tab as fast<br>
                as you can before it closes. You'll get used to it.<br>
                Bam! Now you can do things such as powerwashing/rollbacking your chromebook! (Setting chromebook to a
                previous version/update)</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h2 id="fr">Enable admin (Factory reset)</h2>
            <p>WARNING | I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY TROUBLE YOU GET INTO FOR THIS</p>
            <p>Simply press <code>ESC+REFRESH+POWER</code> and it will bring you to a factory reset screen. To get out of it with no consequences, press the power button (press <code>REFRESH+POWER</code> if stuck) then press <code>CTRL+D</code> while on the factory reset screen to enable developer mode. Then just turn off the chromebook by press <code>REFRESH+POWER</code> to get to the login screen. Boom. Do whatever now.</p>
